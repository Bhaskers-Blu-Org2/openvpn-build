OpenVPN project Microsoft Visual C buildsystem

About

    This subdirectory contains scripts for building OpenVPN
    and all it's dependencies using Microsoft Visual C.

    You need to install Visual Studio 2017 (Community or Professional)
    and ActiveState Perl.

Usage

    Just run build.bat - this downloads and build dependencies and openvpn.

    You can override build options either with build-dev-local.bat or by setting
    enviromental variables in console. For example if you want to build from
    another GitHub fork or branch:

      c:\Temp\openvpn-build\msvc>set GITHUB_USER=lstipakov&& set OPENVPN_VERSION=vs2017&& build.bat

    After command-line build you can use Visual Studio IDE - just open

      openvpn-build\msvc\build.tmp\openvpn-<branch>\openvpn.sln

    Note that by default build.bat builds dependencies for x64 architecture, so don't
    forget to set "Solution Platforms" to "x64".

    When running openvpn from IDE, you either need to copy dependencies (libeay32.dll etc) from

      openvpn-build\msvc\image\bin

    to

      openvpn-build\msvc\build.tmp\openvpn-vs2017\x64-Output\Debug

    or change "Working Directory" to openvpn-build\msvc\image\bin.
